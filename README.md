# WeatherWear

Know the proper clothing attire for today's weather anytime and anywhere!

It utilizes device location tracking, JSON keys, third party tools such as ReactiveCocoa and OpenWeatherMap to fetch the data, and data-based algorithms to calculate and decide which clothing attire to wear. 
Based on the device location, it uses functional programming to create ReactiveCocoa signals, sends them and fetches JSON data from a third-party URL (OpenWeatherMap API), converts it into Objective-C properties, and updates it in the UI. 
Due to the functional programming's capabilities, it can update the location and weather at any time!

WeatherWear is for anyone who has trouble deciding how to dress appropriately for the weather. 
If anyone is running late and has to decide on something to wear quickly, he/she can fire the app and in a couple of swipes, know exactly what to wear for the weather. 
Best of all, it's extremely simple, fast, and easy for anyone to use!
